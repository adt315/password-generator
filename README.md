## Password Generator

The objective of this project was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML were used.

### How it works:
 - When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button they are asked a series of prompts about their password criteria.
 - The user is asked how long they would like their password to be (between 8 and 128 characters) and if they would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters in their password.
- When the user answers all prompts, a password matching their selected criteria is generated and displayed on the screen.
- The user interface is responsive and adapts to multiple screen sizes.
